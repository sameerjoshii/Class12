Normalization is a database design process used to organize a database into tables and columns. The goal is to reduce redundancy and dependency by ensuring that each table contains data related to a single entity. The process involves dividing large tables into smaller ones and defining relationships between them.
Here are the rules and definitions for the first three normal forms (1NF, 2NF, 3NF)

:First Normal Form (1NF)Definition: A table is in 1NF if:It contains only atomic (indivisible) values.Each column contains values of a single type.Each column contains unique values.



Second Normal Form (2NF)Definition: A table is in 2NF if:It is in 1NF.All non-key attributes are fully functional dependent on the primary key.




Third Normal Form (3NF)Definition: A table is in 3NF if:It is in 2NF.All the attributes are functionally dependent only on the primary key





Redundancy: The subject information is repeated for each student in the same class.

Update Anomalies: If a subject changes, you have to update it in multiple rows. If you forget to update one, the data becomes inconsistent.

Insertion Anomalies: You cannot add a subject unless there is at least one student enrolled in that class.


Deletion Anomalies: If you delete the last student from a class, you also lose the information about the subjects of that class.
